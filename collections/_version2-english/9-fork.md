# What is a fork of Augur?

Some people call it Augur's last resort, some call it a nuclear weapon, some call it what they are waiting for, and some call it what they never want to be happened... what in the world is a fork?

The purpose of this section is to get a good understanding of a fork and prepare for it.

The contents are:
 - [Basic knowledge]({{ url_basic_knowledge }})
 - [To-do's]({{ url_todos }})
 - [Restrictions on use]({{ url_restrictions_on_use }})
 - [Migration of the objects]({{ url_migration_of_the_objects }})

If you are a biginner, you should start with [basic knowledge]({{ url_basic_knowledge }}). If you are a REP holder, you must read [to-do's]({{ url_todos }}) to not lose the value of your REP. And if you want to do a deep dive into a fork, check [restrictions on use]({{ url_restrictions_on_use }}) and [migration of the objects]({{ url_migration_of_the_objects }}).
