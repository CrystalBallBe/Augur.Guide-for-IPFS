# What is a fork?
[Forking]({{glossary_fork}}) is the last [market]({{glossary_market}}) resolution method. It is a very disruptive process and is intended to be a rare occurrence.

After a market enters [reporting]({{glossary_report}}), its [initial reporter]({{glossary_initial_reporter}}) submits [initial report]({{glossary_initial_report}}), and the market enters the [dispute round phase]({{glossary_dispute_round_phase}}). and the reported [outcome]({{glossary_outcome}}) becomes the market's [tentative outcome]({{glossary_tentative_outcome}}).
During a [dispute round]({{glossary_dispute_round}}), any [REP]({{glossary_reputation_token}}) holder may [dispute]({{glossary_dispute}}) the tentative outcome by staking REP on an alternative outcome of the market which they consider the "truth". To be successful the dispute, their staking REP needs to reach a certain amount. This amount is called [dispute bond]({{glossary_dispute_bond}}). With each successive dispute round, a higher dispute bond is needed. If the size of dispute bond reaches a certain [threshold](#how-the-market-enters-the-fork-state), the [universe]({{glossary_universe}}) where the disputed market exists is split into multiple universes, one for each possible outcome of the disputed market. This split is the fork.

There are [some things REP holders must do]({{ "/" | absolute_url }}/{{page.collection}}/9-fork/2-to-dos.html) for a fork to not lose their REP.

## What happens when a fork starts?
When a market forks, new [universes]({{glossary_universe}}) are created. Forking creates a new universe for each possible outcome of the market. For example, a market has 3 possible outcomes: `Yes`, `No`, and `Invalid`. When the market forks, 3 new universes are created: universe `Yes`, universe `No`, universe `Invalid`. In each universe, its corresponding outcome becomes the [final outcome]({{glossary_final_outcome}}), such as in the universe `Yes` the final outcome of the [forking market]({{glossary_forking_market}}) is `Yes`, in the universe `No` the final outcome of the forking market is `No`.

The universe that created new universes is called the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}), and the newly created universes are called [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}).

{% include zoom-image.html src=image_src caption="Figure 1. forked universe" %}

## How the market enters the fork state?
If the size of the filled [dispute bond]({{glossary_dispute_bond}}) is greater than or equal to 2.5% of [all theoretical REP]({{glossary_all_theoretical_rep}}), then the market will enter the fork state. This market is referred to as the [forking market]({{glossary_forking_market}}).

For example, the forking market is in the following state:
 - The market has 3 possible outcomes: `Yes`, `No`, and `Invalid`
 - The [creation bond]({{glossary_creation_bond}}) is `0.35` REP
 - All theoretical REP is `11,000,000`
 - 2.5% of all theoretical REP is `275,000`

And assuming that the outcomes `Yes` and `No` are disputed alternately, the changes in the filled dispute bonds which are calculated from the [formula]({{glossary_dispute_bond}}) are shown below:

    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2" colspan="1" class="center">Dispute Round</th>
      <th rowspan="1" colspan="3" class="center">successfully-filled Dispute Bond</th>
    </tr>

    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 3</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >2.1</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  rowspan="1" colspan="4" class="center" >ã€œ</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 18</td>
    <td class="right" >68,812.8</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 19</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >137,625.6</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 20</td>
    <td class="right" ><b>275,251.2</b></td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>

In this case, the threshold (`275,000` REP) is exceeded in Dispute Round 20. That is, a fork occurs when the dispute succeeds in Round 20.

## When does a fork end?
The period from the start to the end of a fork is referred to as the [forking period]({{glossary_forking_period}}). The forking period ends when either 60 days have passed, or more than 50% of [all theoretical REP]({{glossary_all_theoretical_rep}}) is migrated to one of the [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}). Whichever child universe receives the most migrated REP by the end of the forking period becomes the [winning universe]({{glossary_winning_universe}}), the other child universes become the [losing universe]({{glossary_losing_universe}}).

## What happens to the parent universe?
When a fork starts, the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}) becomes permanently locked. In the [locked universe]({{glossary_locked_universe}}), no new [markets]({{glossary_market}}) can be created and no markets can go through the [reporting]({{glossary_report}}) process. As a result of this, no markets can be [finalized](glossary_finalized_market). (See [restrictions on use]({{url_restrictions_on_use}}) for details.)

## What happens to the child universes?
As mentioned [above](#when-does-a-fork-end), when the [forking period]({{glossary_forking_period}}) ends, [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}) become either the [winning universe]({{glossary_winning_universe}}) or a [losing universe]({{glossary_losing_universe}}).

In terms of what you can do, there is no difference between the winning universe and the losing universe. There are no restrictions for either universe. (See [restrictions on use]({{url_restrictions_on_use}}) for details.)

However, all markets in the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}) can only be migrated to the winning universe and the objects attached to the [forking market]({{glossary_forking_market}}), such as [shares]({{glossary_shares}}), [open interest]({{glossary_open_interest}}), [unfilled orders]({{Unfilled_Order}}), are also only migrated to the winning universe. (See [migration of the objects]({{url_migration_of_the_objects}}) for details.)

[REP]({{glossary_reputation_token}}) in any [universe]({{glossary_universe}}) whose forking market outcome was a lie is expected to lose its value, since future traders won't want to trade in a universe where [reporters]({{glossary_reporter}}) have a history of lying which means REP in that universe will not receive a meaningful amount of [trading fees]({{glossary_trading_fee}}). When the system is working correctly, and people are behaving economically rationally (profit motivated), the expectation is that the winning universe will align with the [truth universe]({{glossary_truth_universe}}) and the losing universes will align with the [lying universes]({{glossary_lying_universe}}).
