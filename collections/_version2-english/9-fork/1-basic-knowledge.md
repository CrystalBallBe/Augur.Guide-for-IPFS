# What is a fork?
[Forking]({{glossary_fork}}) is the last [market]({{glossary_market}}) resolution method. It is a very disruptive process and is intended to be a rare occurrence.

After a market enters [reporting]({{glossary_report}}), its [initial reporter]({{glossary_initial_reporter}}) submits [initial report]({{glossary_initial_report}}), and the market enters the [dispute round phase]({{glossary_dispute_round_phase}}). and the reported [outcome]({{glossary_outcome}}) becomes the market's [tentative outcome]({{glossary_tentative_outcome}}).
During a [dispute round]({{glossary_dispute_round}}), any [REP]({{glossary_reputation_token}}) holder may [dispute]({{glossary_dispute}}) the tentative outcome by staking REP on an alternative outcome of the market which they consider the "truth". To be successful the dispute, their staking REP needs to reach a certain amout. This amount is called [dispute bond]({{glossary_dispute_bond}}). With each successive dispute round, a higher dispute bond is needed. If the size of dispute bond reaches a certain [threshold](#how-the-market-enters-the-fork-state), the [universe]({{glossary_universe}}) where the diputed market exists is split into multiple universe, one for each possible outcome of the disputed market. This split is the fork.

There are [somethings REP holders must do]({{ "/" | absolute_url }}/{{page.collection}}/9-fork/2-to-dos.html) for a fork to not lose their REP.

## What happens when a fork starts?
When a market forks, new [universes]({{glossary_universe}}) are created. Forking creates a new universe for each possible outcome of the market. For example, a market has 3 possible outcomes: `Yes`, `No`, and `Invalid`. When the market forks, 3 new universes are created: universe `Yes`, universe `No`, universe `Invalid`. In each universe, its corresponding outcome becomes the [final outcome]({{glossary_final_outcome}}), such as in the universe `Yes` the final outcome of the [forking market]({{glossary_forking_market}}) is `Yes`, in the universe `No` the final outcome of the forking market is `No`.

The universe that created new universes is called the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}), and the newly created universes are called [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}).

{% include zoom-image.html src=image_src caption="Figure 1. forked universe" %}

## How the market enters the fork state?
If the size of the filled [dispute bond]({{glossary_dispute_bond}}) is greater than or equal to 2.5% of [all theoretical REP]({{glossary_all_theoretical_rep}}), then the market will enter the fork state. This market is referred to as the [forking market]({{glossary_forking_market}}).

For example, the forking market is in the following state:
 - The market has 3 possible outcomes: `Yes`, `No`, and `Invalid`
 - The [creation bond]({{glossary_creation_bond}}) is `0.35` REP
 - All theoretical REP is `11,000,000`
 - 2.5% of all theoretical REP is `275,000`

And assuming that the outcomes `Yes` and `No` are disputed alternately, the changes in the filled dispute bonds which are calculated from the [formula]({{glossary_dispute_bond}}) are shown below:

  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 18</td>
    <td class="right" >68,812.8</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 19</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >137,625.6</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center" >Dispute Round 20</td>
    <td class="right" ><b>275,251.2</b></td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
    <td class="right" >0</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>

In this case, the threshold (`275,000` REP) is exceeded in Dispute Round 20. That is a fork occurs when the dispute succeeds in Round 20.

## When does a fork end?
The period from the start to the end of a fork is referred to as the [forking period]({{glossary_forking_period}}). The forking period ends when either 60 days have passed, or more than 50% of [all theoretical REP]({{glossary_all_theoretical_rep}}) is migrated to some [child universe]({{glossary_child_universe}}). Whichever child universe receives the most migrated REP by the end of the forking period becomes the [winning universe]({{glossary_winning_universe}}), the other child universes become the [losing universe]({{glossary_losing_universe}}).
