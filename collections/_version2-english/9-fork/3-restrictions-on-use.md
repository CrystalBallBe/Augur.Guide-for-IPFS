# What can users do during/after a fork?
The [whitepaper](https://github.com/AugurProject/whitepaper/blob/master/v2/english/augur-whitepaper-v2.pdf) says:

> When a fork is initiated, the parent universe becomes permanently locked. In a locked universe, no new markets may be created and no REP can be staked on any market. Therefore markets in a locked universe cannot be finalized. However, users may continue trading shares in markets in locked universes. In order for markets or REP tokens in the locked universe to be useful, they must first be migrated to a child universe.

Then, what is a [locked universe]({{glossary_locked_universe}})? And what can users do in the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}) and [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}) specifically? The purpose of this page is to clear up those questions.

## Summary
From a conclusion, when a [fork]({{glossary_fork}}) starts, in the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}), [REP]({{glossary_reputation_token}}) cannot be staked on any [market]({{glossary_market}}) and markets cannot be [finalized]({{glossary_finalized_market}}), in addition to that, new markets cannot be created. On the other hand, in [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}), users can do anything right after it is created.

Now let's break it down into each phase and see more details.

## Before a Fork
Before a [fork]({{glossary_fork}}), there are no restrictions in the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}). And [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}) are not yet created at this point.

## After a Fork
After a fork starts, REP holders cannot stake [REP]({{glossary_reputation_token}}) on any [market]({{glossary_market}}) in the [parent universe]({{glossary_parent_universe}}), since REP in the parent universe needs to be migrated to one of the [child universes]({{glossary_child_universe}}). Therefore, markets in the parent universe are never [finalized]({{glossary_finalized_market}}). And users may not create new markets in the parent univese after a fork starts.

Even if a market in the parent universe has not been migrated to the [winning universe]({{glossary_winning_universe}}), users may trade and [settle]({{glossary_settlement}}) their [shares]({{glossary_share}}) on the market. It does not matter whether the market is already finalized or not, users can do those on any market in the parent universe. Trading in the parent universe, traders pay [creator fee]({{glossary_creator_fee}}) and [reporting fee]({{glossary_reporting_fee}}), and those fees are added to [reporting fee pool]({{glossary_reporting_fee_pool}}). So users may purchase [participation tokens]({{glossary_participation_token}}) to collect those fees and redeem them.

In child universes, there are no restrictions. It doesn't matter whether a child universe is winning one or losing one. You can do everything on it as soon as it is created.  Note: child universes are not created as soon as a fork starts, they are created when the first time REP is migrated to them (See [migration of the objects]({{url_migration_of_the_objects}}#forking-market) for details).
