      </td>
      <td> Cash is an ERC-20 token that is used within Augur’s Solidity smart contracts and acts as a wrapper for ETH to facilitate some of Augur’s functionality. Users do not interact directly with Cash tokens in Augur. </td>

      </td>
      <td> A categorical market can have up to 8 possible choices for answers, and the answers are defined by the market creator. Each potential answer has its own order book, so it is more complicated to trade. Note that Augur can only resolve one answer as the correct result. So if the question is worded in such a way that more than one answer is correct, the market should resolve as Invalid.<br /><br />Buying SHARES of a potential outcome is as straightforward as buying Yes in a Yes/No market, but selling SHARES of an outcome you do not own will actually result in you owning SHARES of all the other outcomes.<br /><br />In the event that a categorical market resolves as Invalid, every SHARE is worth 1 ETH divided by the number of outcomes. For example, if there were 8 outcomes, each SHARE would be worth 0.125 ETH each. </td>

      </td>
      <td> A Complete Set is a collection of Shares in every Outcome. Complete Sets are created when the Creator and Filler of an Order both use currency to pay for the trade, as opposed to one or both parties using Shares to complete the Trade. When both parties use shares to complete a trade, then a Complete Set will be formed and Settled (destroyed). The cost in attoETH of a Complete Set for a particular Market is determined by the Number of Ticks for that Market. When Complete Sets are Settled, Settlement Fees are extracted from the value of the Complete Set and are paid proportionally by both parties. Therefore, users who get a larger payout from Settlement also pay a larger portion of the fees. The Settlement Fees extracted from Share Settlement go toward paying for the Reporting system, in the form of a Reporting Fee, and paying the Market Creator their set Creator Fee. </td>

      </td>
      <td> A Creator Fee is a percentage fee, in ETH, that is collected by the Market Creator whenever Shares are Settled. It is set by the Market Creator when he or she creates a new Market. The Creator Fee must be between 0% and 50%, and it cannot be changed once it has been set. The Creator Fee and the Reporting Fee are both extracted at the same time whenever Shares are Settled. Shares can be Settled when a user sells a Complete Set or when the Market has been Finalized and a user wants to close an open Position. The Creator Fee is designed to incentivize users to make popular Markets as they stand to earn money if enough people trade on the Market. They can then recoup their Market creation cost and ideally turn a profit on posting interesting Markets. The Settlement Fees are discussed in more details in the Trading section of the documentation. </td>

If users Stake enough REP on that Outcome to fill the Dispute Bond and Challenge the Tentative Outcome, that Outcome will become the new Tentative Outcome (and the Market will go through another Dispute Round), or the Market will Fork (if a Dispute Bond greater than the Fork Threshold is filled). If the Dispute Bond is successfully filled, and that Outcome becomes the Final Outcome for the Market, the users who Staked REP on that Outcome can get back 1.5x the amount of REP they originally Staked, once the Market is Finalized. If the Dispute Bond is successfully filled, but that Outcome does not become the Final Outcome for the Market, the users who Staked REP on that Outcome will forfeit all of the REP they Staked.

Note that this amount is calculated differently than the No-Show Bond. During the very first Fee Window after launch, the amount of the Designated Reporter Stake will be set at 0.35 REP. The amount of the Designated Reporter Stake is dynamically adjusted according to how many Designated Reports were incorrect (failed to concur with the Market’s Final Outcome) during the previous Fee Window. </td>

During this time, the Designated Reporter is expected to Report a Tentative Outcome for the Market. When the Designated Reporter submits a Report, the Market will enter the Waiting for the Next Fee Window to Begin Phase. If the Designated Reporter fails to Report on the Market within the Designated Reporting Phase, then the Market goes to the Open Reporting Phase. When this happens, the Market Creator does not get refunded the No-Show Bond. Instead, the No-Show Bond goes toward covering the Stake of the First Public Reporter when they submit the First Public Report. </td>

      </td>
      <td> Dispute is used to describe the act of a REP holder Staking REP on a Market Outcome other than the Tentative Outcome for that Market. This REP is sent to a Crowdsourcer and goes toward filling a Dispute Bond for that Outcome in order to Dispute or “challenge” the Tentative Outcome of a Market before it is Finalized. If the Dispute Bond is successfully filled, and that Outcome becomes the Final Outcome for the Market, the users who Staked REP on that Outcome can get back 1.5x the amount of REP they originally Staked, once the Market is Finalized. If the Dispute Bond is successfully filled, but that Outcome does not become the Final Outcome for the Market, the users who Staked REP on that Outcome will forfeit all of the REP they Staked.

      </td>
      <td> When a Market is in the Dispute Round Phase, users may Stake REP on an Outcome other than the Tentative Outcome if they believe the Tentative Outcome is incorrect. Doing so contributes to a Dispute Bond for that Outcome. Each Outcome other than the Tentative Outcome has its own Dispute Bond that can be filled. Dispute Bonds need not be paid in their entirety by a single user. Augur allows participants to Crowdsource the Dispute Bonds. Any user who sees an incorrect Tentative Outcome can dispute that Outcome by Staking some REP on an Outcome other than the Tentative Outcome. If, collectively, some Outcome (other than the Tentative Outcome) receives enough Dispute Stake to fill its Dispute Bond, the current Tentative Outcome will be successfully Challenged. For information about how Dispute Stake gets returned to users, refer to the Dispute Stake glossary entry. The Dispute Bond sizes are chosen this way to ensure a fix ROI of 50% for Reporters who successfully Dispute false outcomes. </td>

During a Dispute Round, REP holders who do not agree that the Market’s Tentative Outcome is accurate can Stake REP on a different Outcome in an attempt to Challenge it. If the Challenge is successful, the Tentative Outcome will be changed to the Outcome that was Staked on, or the Market will Fork if a Dispute Bond greater than the Fork Threshold is filled. </td>

If the Challenge is successful, the Tentative Outcome will be changed to the Outcome that was Staked on, or the Market will Fork if a Dispute Bond greater than the Fork Threshold is filled. With each Dispute Round that successfully Challenges the Tentative Outcome, the next Dispute Round will require an even higher Dispute Bond to Challenge the Tentative Outcome.

      </td>
      <td>  When a Market is in the Dispute Round Phase, users can put up REP on any Outcome other than the Tenative Outcome. The amount of REP they put up goes toward filling the crowdsourced Dispute Bond, and can range from 1 attoREP to the amount still needed to fill the Dispute Bond. <br /> <br /> All unsuccesful Dispute Stake is returned to the original owners at the end of every Dispute Round. All successful Dispute Stake is applied to the Outcome it championed, and will remain there until the Market is Finalized (or until a Fork occurs in some other Augur Market). Once the Market is Finalized, all users who Staked on the Final Outcome during a Dispute Round will receive 1.5x the amount of REP they originally Staked. REP holders who staked on an Outcome other than the Final Outcome forfeit their REP. All Dispute Stake (whether successful or unsuccessful) will receive a portion of the Reporting Fee Pool from the current Fee Window in ETH. (This ETH comes from trading and winning Share redemption: fees are collected in ETH whenever a Complete Set is sold or winning Shares are redeemed and given to Fee Windows.)<br /> <br /> By design, the Dispute Bond sizes for each Dispute Round are chosen such that anyone who successfully Challenges an Outcome in favor of the Market’s Final Outcome is rewarded with a 50% ROI on their Dispute Stake.

Then, when the Crowdsourcer’s Market is Finalized, these Dispute Tokens are used by Augur’s smart contracts to determine the payout that user should receive. Dispute Tokens are only used internally by Augur, and users do not interact with them directly; however, they are implemented as ERC-20 tokens, so they potentially can be traded between users. (For example, a user might want to sell their Dispute Tokens to another user at a discounted price if a Market is being Disputed for a long time and the user wishes to cash out their Dispute Tokens before the Market is Finalized.) </td>

This means the Reporting Fee will go up if the market cap of REP is not sufficiently high (but will never be higher than 33.3%) and will go down if it is higher than this target.<br /> <br /> The Reporting Fee is sent to the Fee Window that contains the Market being traded on, and is later used to pay REP holders for engaging in Reporting. </td>

The field can either be blank to represent 'General Knowledge', or a URL to a specific web site. The best source to use depends on the type of market. Typically, General Knowledge should be used (since it provides redundancy) unless there is variation in the answer amongst different sources. A good example of this is cryptocurrency prices. Since they vary dramatically in different markets, using a specific resolution source is needed (otherwise the market has a high risk of resolving invalid, due to multiple answers being possible). </td>

      <td> These are the most complicated markets to understand, but provide the most flexibility in the number of potential outcomes and how they are paid out. In the other two market types, only the one true outcome is worth any ETH once the market is finalized and valid. All the other outcomes are worth nothing, but that is not true for scalar markets. Since these are the most complicated to understand, it is probably best to avoid this kind of market until you are more comfortable with Augur.<br /><br />An example of a Scalar Market would be “According to finance.yahoo.com, what will be the price of MSFT on January 3rd, 2020 at exactly 1:00pm EST?”. In this example market, potential answers might range from $0 to $500, because a lower and upper bound are required to be defined when the market is created. In addition, the market creator had to specify the precision for the market, which determines how many individual price points are available as choices between $0 and $500.<br /><br />A trader in this example would have to decide whether to go LONG (Buy) or SHORT (Sell) on this market, and at a specific price. The trader in a LONG position makes more money the higher the final result is above the specific price, and loses money if the final result is below the specific price. The opposite is true for the trader who took the SHORT position.<br /><br />In the case of Invalid, the final answer becomes the midpoint between the lower bound and upper bound. </td>

      <td> A trader can close their Position in one of two ways: by selling the Shares they hold to another trader in exchange for Ether, or by Settling their Shares with Augur’s smart contracts. Every Share in a Market comes into existence as part of a Complete Set when an amount of Ether equal to the Number of Ticks for that Market has been escrowed with Augur. To get that Ether out of escrow, traders must give Augur either a Complete Set, or — if the Market has Finalized — a Share of the winning Outcome. This exchange is referred to as Settlement.<br /> <br /> For example, consider a non-Finalized Market with possible Outcomes A and B. Suppose Alice has a Share of Outcome A that she wants to sell for 0.70 ETH and Bob has a Share of Outcome B that he wants to sell for 0.30 ETH. First, Augur matches these Orders and collects the A and B Shares from the participants. Then Augur gives 0.70 ETH (minus Settlement Fees) to Alice and 0.30 ETH (minus Settlement Fees) to Bob.<br /> <br /> As a second example, consider a Finalized Market whose winning Outcome is A. Alice has a Share of A and wants to cash it in. She sends her share of A to Augur and in return receives 1 ETH (minus Settlement Fees).<br /> <br /> The Settlement Fees, which include both the Creator Fee and the Reporting Fee, are only extracted during Settlement. </td>

Once a Fork Phase begins, REP holders can choose to migrate their REP to one of the new Child Universes. They don’t have to migrate, but Locked Universes do not allow the creation of new Markets, and therefore there will be no Markets to Report on in the future and no Fees to earn.

In the default Augur UI, the No option and order book is hidden, to simplify these types of markets even further. That means you can only buy or sell SHARES of Yes. If you do happen to sell SHARES of Yes to someone else (and you don’t actually own any Yes SHARES), Augur will create a complete set of both Yes and No SHARES and give you the No SHARES. In the Augur UI, this will show up as a negative quantity of Yes.<br /><br />In the event that a yes/no market resolves as Invalid, each Yes or No share is worth 0.5 ETH each. Note that depending on the price you paid for that Yes or No share, it is possible that you can win or lose money on an Invalid result. This is planned to change in Augur version 2, where Invalid will become a tradeable outcome such that Yes or No shares will be worth 0 if the market resolves to Invalid. </td>
